# ANSYS Simulations

A collection of engineering simulations built using ANSYS. Includes FEA, CFD, thermal, and modal analysis examples. Each folder contains input files, screenshots, and documentation of the simulation process.

---

## 🔧 Simulation Areas

- **Structural Analysis** — Stress, deformation, constraints, failure modes
- **Thermal Analysis** — Steady-state and transient temperature distributions
- **CFD** — Airflow and fluid dynamics (if included)

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each simulation project folder includes:
- `description.md` — Summary of the problem, setup, and results
- `visuals/` — Key images or animations
- `input_files/` — Geometry, mesh, or export files (if sharable)
